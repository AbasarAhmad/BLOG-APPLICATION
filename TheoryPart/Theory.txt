BLOG APPLICATION – COMPLETE PROJECT EXPLANATION
1. Project Overview
	This project is a RESTful Blog Application backend developed using Spring Boot.
	It provides secure APIs for managing users, posts, categories, comments, and images.

  Key Features:
	User registration and login using JWT authentication
	Role-based authorization (ADMIN / NORMAL user)
	CRUD operations for Users, Posts, Categories, and Comments
	Pagination, sorting, and search functionality
	Image upload and download support
	Centralized exception handling
	Stateless and secure architecture

2. Technologies Used
	Backend & Core Framework
	Java
	Spring Boot – Rapid application development and auto-configuration
	Spring Modules
	Spring Web – REST API development
	Spring Data JPA – ORM and database interaction
	Spring Security – Authentication and authorization
	JWT (JSON Web Token) – Stateless security
	Jakarta Validation – Request validation

  Database
	MySQL – Relational database

  Utilities & Tools
	Hibernate – JPA implementation
	ModelMapper – Entity to DTO conversion
	Lombok – Boilerplate code reduction
	BCrypt Password Encoder – Secure password hashing

3. Application Architecture

 Benefits:
	Loose coupling
	Easy maintenance
	Better scalability
	Clean separation of responsibilities

4. Entity and Database Design
	Core Entities:
 User
	Fields: id, name, email, password, about
	Implements UserDetails for Spring Security
	Relationships:
	One User → Many Posts
	Many Users ↔ Many Roles

 Role
	Fields: id, name
	Used for authorization (ADMIN, NORMAL)

 Category
	Fields: title, description
	One Category → Many Posts

 Post
	Fields: title, content, imageName, addedDate
	Relationships:
	Many Posts → One User
	Many Posts → One Category
	One Post → Many Comments

 Comment
	Fields: content
	Many Comments → One Post
	All relationships are mapped using JPA annotations.

5. DTO (Data Transfer Object) Layer
 Why DTOs?
	Prevent direct exposure of entities
	Avoid security issues (e.g., password leakage)
	Prevent circular reference problems
	Keep API responses clean and controlled

Examples:   UserDto,PostDto,CategoryDto,CommentDto, PostResponse (for pagination)

6. Authentication Flow (JWT Based)
	Login API
	POST /api/v1/auth/login
  Flow:
	User sends email and password
	AuthenticationManager authenticates the user
	CustomUserDetailService loads user from the database
	Password is verified using BCrypt
	JWT token is generated
	Token is returned to the client

7. JWT Token Working
    Token Contains:
	Subject (user email)
	Issue time
	Expiration time
	Signed using HS512 algorithm

    Why JWT?
	Stateless authentication : Stateless authentication means the server doesn’t store session info; the token itself carries everything 						needed for authentication.
	No server-side session storage
	Scalable and secure

8. Request Authorization Flow
   For protected APIs:
	Client sends request with header:
	Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
	JwtAuthenticationFilter:
	Extracts token
	Retrieves username
	Loads user details
	Validates token
	Authentication is set in SecurityContextHolder
	Request is allowed to access controller
	❌ Invalid or missing token → 401 Unauthorized

9. Role-Based Authorization
	Roles are stored in the database
	User roles are converted to authorities
	Method-level security using annotations

Example:  @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('ADMIN')")
	Only ADMIN users can delete users.

10. Security Configuration Summary
	CSRF disabled (JWT-based REST API)
	Stateless session management
  Public APIs:
	/api/v1/auth/**
  All GET requests
	Secured APIs:
	POST / PUT / DELETE requests
	JWT filter added before Spring Security authentication filter

11. Pagination and Sorting
	GET /api/post/getAll?pageNumber=0&pageSize=10&sortBy=title&sortDir=asc


12. Image Upload and Download
	Image stored on server file system
	Unique filename generated using UUID
	Filename saved in database

Download Image
	GET /api/post/image/{imageName}
	Image streamed directly to browser

13. Search Functionality
	GET /api/post/getPostBy/{keyword}
  Uses Spring Data JPA method:
	findByTitleContaining()
	Supports partial and case-insensitive search

14. Validation Handling
  Validation annotations:
	@NotBlank
	@Size
	@Email

15. Global Exception Handling
	Implemented using @ControllerAdvice
  Handles:
	ResourceNotFoundException → 404
	Validation errors → 400
	ApiException → 400
	Unauthorized access → 401
	Ensures consistent and clean API responses.

17. Project Strengths

	Production-ready and interview-ready

18. Interview Summary (One Line)

“I developed a secure RESTful Blog Application using Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT, and JPA with role-based authorization, pagination, search, image upload, and centralized exception handling following industry best practices.”





JWT vs Role-Based – Clear Difference
		Aspect	  			JWT Authentication			Role-Based Authorization
		Purpose	  			Identify the user			Control access
		Question answered		Who are you?				What can you do?
		Used for			Login & identity			Permission check
		Stateless			Yes					Works on top of authentication
		Example				Valid JWT token				ADMIN vs NORMAL

How both work together in Blog project
Step-by-step flow

Login
	User logs in
	JWT token generated

Request
	Client sends JWT token
Authentication
	JWT filter validates token
	User is authenticated

Authorization
	Role is checked (ADMIN / NORMAL)
	Access granted or denied

👉 JWT        =     Authentication
👉 Role-based =     Authorization
